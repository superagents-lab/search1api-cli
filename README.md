# search1api-cli

Command-line interface for [Search1API](https://s1.dev) — web search, news, crawl, sitemap, trending, and turning a URL into an Agent Skill, from your terminal.

## Installation

### Quick install (no Node.js required)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.search1api.com/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads a standalone binary and installs it as `s1`.

### Via npm

```bash
npm install -g search1api-cli
```

This installs two commands: `search1api` and `s1` (shorthand).

## Updating

```bash
s1 update
```

`s1 update` updates you in place using whichever method you installed with:

- **Binary install** — downloads the latest release for your platform and replaces the running binary (uses `sudo` automatically if needed).
- **npm install** — prints the `npm install -g search1api-cli` command to run.

`s1` also checks for new versions in the background and shows a notice when one is available.

## Setup

Authorize the CLI with OAuth 2.1 in your browser. The CLI dynamically registers
as a public client, uses Authorization Code with PKCE, and refreshes access
tokens automatically:

```bash
s1 login
```

Manual fallback:

```bash
s1 config set-key <your-api-key>
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
export SEARCH1API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Commands

Turn a URL into an installable Agent Skill directory.

```bash
s1 learn https://example.com/guide --name example-setup       # one page
s1 learn https://example.com/docs --site --discover           # what would be learned, crawls nothing
s1 learn https://example.com/docs --site --name example-api   # crawl and stage
s1 learn https://example.com/docs --site --exclude /docs/cloud --name example-api
s1 learn --from <staged dir> --install project                # install, no crawl
s1 learn --from <staged dir> --install global --name better-name   # install under a new name
s1 learn --refresh ~/.agents/skills/example-api                # relearn, same source and scope
s1 learn --validate ~/.agents/skills/example-api              # static checks, exit 1 on errors
```

```
<name>/
  SKILL.md                 # routing layer: when to use, what is in references/
  references/*.md          # page content with title/url frontmatter
  references/sources.json  # source URLs, hashes, and any pages that failed
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--name <name>` | **Required.** You choose it; the CLI never derives one | |
| `--site` | Learn everything under the URL's path, not just that page | off |
| `--discover` | With `--site`: print the section breakdown and stop | off |
| `--exclude <paths...>` | Path prefixes to leave out | |
| `--max-pages <N>` | Safety valve, not a knob to tune | 500 |
| `--out <dir>` | Where to write the directory | staging dir under the cache |
| `--from <dir>` | Install an already-learned directory instead of crawling | |
| `--refresh <dir>` | Relearn using the source, mode and `--exclude` it recorded | |
| `--validate <dir>` | Report problems in a learned directory | |
| `--install <scope>` | `global` (`~/.agents/skills/`) or `project` (`./.agents/skills/`) | not installed |
| `--json` | Output raw JSON | |

`--site` reads the site's published sitemap in one call and keeps what lives
under the URL you pointed at — the docs root gets everything, `/docs/api` gets
just that section — so the page count comes from the site rather than from a
budget you have to guess. `--discover` shows that breakdown first.

One run produces one skill, and one bundle per documentation set is the default.
Point at a single section only when that section is plainly its own job; before
crawling you only have URLs, and grouping pages by their slugs guesses wrong on
the pages that matter.

Nothing is installed unless `--install` is passed, and a directory `s1 learn`
did not create is never overwritten. Relearning the same URL rewrites
`references/`, reports what changed, and keeps a `SKILL.md` you have edited.

Installing writes the skill to the store (`~/.agents/skills/<name>`) **and links
it into the agent directories that already exist beside it** — `.claude/skills`,
`.cursor/skills`, `.codex/skills` — because agents read their own directory, not
the store. The output names every link it made, and says so when it found none:

```
$ s1 learn --from ~/.cache/search1api/learn/example-api --install global
example-api installed to /Users/you/.agents/skills/example-api
Linked into /Users/you/.claude/skills/example-api, /Users/you/.codex/skills/example-api
```

It never creates a directory for a tool you have not set up, and never replaces
an entry that is already there.

**A freshly learned skill is not usable yet.** `s1 learn` writes a placeholder
description, and an agent will not select a skill that still carries it — the
command says so when it finishes, and `--validate` fails with a non-zero exit:

```
$ s1 learn --validate ~/.agents/skills/example-api
error  SKILL.md still has the generated description, so this skill will not trigger.
```

Rewrite the description to name the topics the skill answers, and turn the
generated page list into a routing table, before calling it done.

`--name` on install renames the folder, the frontmatter and `sources.json`
together, so you can learn under a working name and settle on the real one after
reading what the pages actually contain.

`--exclude` drops whole path prefixes, but a section is not automatically one
thing: umami's `/docs/guides` holds 21 hosting guides and 11 core how-tos.
Point `--discover` at a section before excluding it.

Page content is written straight to disk. The command prints a summary, and
`--json` lists only `file`, `url`, and `title` per page — so learning a large
site does not push its text through the agent that ran it.

### trending

Get trending topics from popular platforms.

```bash
s1 trending github
s1 trending hackernews -n 20
```

Available services: `github`, `hackernews`

### balance

Check your remaining API credits.

```bash
s1 balance
```

### login

Authorize in your browser with OAuth 2.1 and PKCE.

```bash
s1 login
s1 login --no-browser
```

### config

Manage CLI configuration.

```bash
s1 config set-key <key>   # Save API key manually
s1 config show            # Show current config
s1 config clear           # Remove saved OAuth tokens and API keys
```

### update

Update `s1` to the latest version. See [Updating](#updating).

```bash
s1 update
s1 update --force   # reinstall even if already on the latest version
```

## SDK

Plugin and integration packages can reuse the CLI's authentication, OAuth
refresh, request handling, and typed Search1API methods instead of maintaining
a second client:

```ts
import { search, crawl } from "search1api-cli/sdk";

const results = await search("OpenCode plugins", {
  maxResults: 5,
  searchService: "github",
});

const page = await crawl("https://example.com");
```

The SDK uses `SEARCH1API_KEY`, the shared `s1 login` OAuth session, or the
optional per-call `apiKey`. Every method also accepts an `AbortSignal` so host
applications can cancel tool calls.

## Agent skill and plugins

This repo is the shared distribution point for the Search1API Agent Skill and
compatibility manifests for ChatGPT/Codex and Cursor. The Claude plugin,
OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Grok Build plugins reuse the same Search1API SDK,
hosted MCP server, and research workflow from their own repositories.

### Agent Skill

Install the standalone skill:

```bash
npx skills add superagents-lab/search1api-cli
```

### Claude

Search1API is listed in the Claude directory as a connector:
[claude.ai/directory/connectors/search1api](https://claude.ai/directory/connectors/search1api).
Add it from **Customize > Connectors** in claude.ai; it also works in Claude
Code. The Claude plugin, which pairs the connector with a research skill, is
maintained in
[`search1api-mcp/claude-plugin`](https://github.com/superagents-lab/search1api-mcp/tree/main/claude-plugin).

To use the `s1` CLI from Claude Code instead, install the standalone skill with
`npx skills add superagents-lab/search1api-cli`.

### Codex

Add this repository as a Codex marketplace, then install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add superagents-lab/search1api-cli
codex plugin add search1api@superagents-lab
```

### Grok Build

Install the dedicated
[`grok-search1api`](https://github.com/superagents-lab/grok-search1api)
plugin directly from GitHub:

```bash
agent plugin install superagents-lab/grok-search1api --trust
```

The same repository can also be added as a custom Grok marketplace:

```bash
agent plugin marketplace add superagents-lab/grok-search1api
```

### OpenCode and OpenClaw

Install the dedicated OpenCode plugin from npm:

```bash
opencode plugin opencode-search1api
```

Install the dedicated OpenClaw plugin from ClawHub:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@fatwang2/openclaw-search1api
```

See the source repositories for platform-specific configuration and release
details:

- [`opencode-search1api`](https://github.com/superagents-lab/opencode-search1api)
- [`openclaw-search1api`](https://github.com/superagents-lab/openclaw-search1api)
- [`grok-search1api`](https://github.com/superagents-lab/grok-search1api)

### Development and directories

The remote server is also published as
[`io.github.superagents-lab/search1api`](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.superagents-lab%2Fsearch1api)
in the official MCP Registry. Directory reviewers can use the
[submission kit](docs/directory-submission.md) for verified URLs, listing copy,
authentication details, use cases, and test cases. The Cursor manifest in this
repository is available for local or team testing; public Cursor Marketplace
availability is a separate review process.

Once installed, you can ask the host agent things like:
- "search for the latest AI news"
- "what does this link say? https://example.com"
- "what's trending on GitHub?"
- "research quantum computing thoroughly"
- "learn these docs so you can use them later"

The plugin uses the hosted Search1API MCP tools and the shared research skill;
the `s1` CLI remains available as a fallback where supported.

## JSON Output

All commands support `--json` flag to output raw JSON, useful for piping and scripting:

```bash
s1 search "test" --json | jq '.results[0].title'
s1 balance --json
```
